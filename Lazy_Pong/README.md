# Pong Game in Python

## üåü Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game in Python using the Pygame library. In this game, two players control paddles, trying to bounce a ball back and forth. The goal is to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

Based on the previous version of [Ben Sicat](https://github.com/Ben-Sicat)

## üìù Prerequisites
Before running the game, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  to run this script, and also [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml). You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
## üéÆ How to Play

- Run the script with Python
- The game window will appear with two paddles and a ball in the middle.
- Use the arrow keys to control your paddle (Player 1) up and down.
- The CPU controls the other paddle (Player 2).
- The game starts when you press any arrow key. The ball will start moving in a random direction.
- The goal is to bounce the ball past your opponent's paddle and score points.
- The game continues until one player reaches the specified maximum score.
- If you win, your name will be displayed as the winner.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can configure the game by modifying the script's parameters, such as screen width, screen height, player name, color, frames per second (fps), and maximum score.

```bash
python pong.py [-h] [-dw WIDTH] [-dh HEIGHT] [-n NAME] [-c COLOR] [--fps FPS] [--max_score MAX_SCORE]
options:
  -h, --help            		Show help message and exit
  -dw WIDTH, --width WIDTH		Width of the display (dflt 320)
  -dh HEIGHT, --height HEIGHT	Height of the display (dflt 240)
  -n NAME, --name NAME  		Player name
  -c COLOR, --color COLOR	  	Game color (dflt light grey)
  --fps FPS             		Framerate (dflt 120)
  --max_score MAX_SCORE         Max score to win (dflt 10)

```
