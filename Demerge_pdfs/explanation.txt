This python script was a interactive program.
It means the program when executed asks user to input and runs accordingly.
Note: 
1. We should be careful while giving no.of pages as input. If the given input exceeds the limit it will yell "Limit Exceeded!".
2. We can always come out of the program if we need only some part of pdf.
   Example: If we have a pdf of 400 pages and we need only first 200 pages of it in 2 different pages
            then we can input for those 2 pdfs and then PRESS CMD+C(Mac) or CTRL+C(windows)
