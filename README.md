## ![image](IMG/aiming.svg) Aim Of The Project

As a Python newbie, I understand the problems that people face when they first begin studying and attempting to understand various Data Science concepts, particularly Python. This project is designed for folks who are just getting started with Python principles and exploring GitHub as "contributors."

My goal is to build a common playground where everyone, from beginners to experts, can learn and share knowledge, and I hope you enjoy your stay here!

Let's "folk-ing" create amazing things together! üëâ

Step 3: Clone it
</summary>

- **Method 1:** GitHub Desktop

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** If you're not familiar with Git, using **GitHub Desktop Application** is a better start. If you choose this method, make sure to download it before continuing reading.
>
> ‚ùó‚ùó Access link to download [**here**](https://desktop.github.com).

Learn more about how to clone the remote respository on your local machine using **GitHub Desktop** [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop#cloning-a-repository).

- **Method 2:** Git

Clone the forked repository. Open git bash and type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/python-mini-project.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

Learn more about [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

Step 4: Create your feature branch 
</summary>

Always keep your local copy of the repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, follow the following steps:

- **Method 1:** GitHub Desktop

Learn more about how to create new branch [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches#creating-a-branch) and how to fetch and pull origin from/to your local machine [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/keeping-your-local-repository-in-sync-with-github/syncing-your-branch).

Learn more about how to fetch and pull origin from/to your local machine using **GitHub Desktop** [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/keeping-your-local-repository-in-sync-with-github/syncing-your-branch).

- **Method 2:** Git

Run the following commands **_carefully_** to update your local repository

```sh
# If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream
git checkout <master>
git pull upstream <master>

# Make a feature branch (Always check your current branch is up to date before creating a new branch from it to avoid merge conflicts)
git checkout -b <branch-name>

#
```

<details>
<summary>
Step 5: Ready, Set, Go...
</summary>

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing to the project and creating **pull requests**.

- Create a folder in
  [projects directory](https://github.com/ndleah/python-mini-project) according to your project name.
  > The folder name should follow the following format "Your_Project_Name_Here". For example: Dice_Stimulator
- Write your code and add to the respective folder in the projects directory, locally.
- Don't forget to add a `README.md` in your folder, according to the
  [README_TEMPLATE.](https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md)

* **Method 1:** GitHub Desktop

Learn more how to pull request from your local machine using **GitHub Desktop** to the main repo [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/viewing-a-pull-request-in-github-desktop).

- **Method 2:** Git

Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit`:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<your message>"
```

Push the code _to your repository_.

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Step 6: Pull Request
</summary>

Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and **make a pull request**:

![pull request image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rgbCcBNZcdQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Now wait, until _your Pull Request_ is approved! If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.
