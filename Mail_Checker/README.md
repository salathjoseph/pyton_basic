## üõ†Ô∏è Description
<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
Mail-Checker is a python script that lets you read your gmail subjects from particular gmail accounts directly from the terminal without having to login each time!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Languages or Frameworks Used
<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->

We only require 'imaplib' python library to run this, this package is built-in to python, just import and use it!

                          import imaplib

I have attached a requirements.txt file that will install the neccessary python library needed for this script, in case if it turns out to be missing in your system. Run the command given below in the shell  to install the requirements!

                    pip install -r requirements.txt 


Once you do  this your script should be ready to use, make sure to  add your account credentials and make other personalizations.

## üåü How to run
<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
Before you try to execute this script make sure you allow less secure app access in your google account

To allow less secure apps click [here to go to your google account]( https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps ). Allowing this does not compromise the security of your account! It only gives permission for applications such as this one to remotely check your emails. 

Run the code the  same way you would run any python code ie, such as in text editors or IDEs like VSCode and view your outputs in your terminal window. 

It should look something like this!
