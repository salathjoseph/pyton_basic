# Speaking Dictionary
Speaking Dictionary is Python program that allows the user to find the meaning of English word by speaking it directly to the program(device). Then, the program(device) will directly explain the definition of the word out loud.

### Prerequisites
pyttsx3: pip install pyttsx3
PyDictionary: pip install PyDictionary
speech recognition: pip install SpeechRecognition
gTTS: pip install gtts

+pip install pyaudio

### How to run the script
SpeakingDictionary.py
1. Say 'hello' first to initiate the Speaking Dictionary
2. When the SpeakingEngine says, "Which word do you want to find?", speak the word slowly and correctly.
3. When the Recognizer recognized the word, it will ask if it recognized the correct word.
4. If you say "yes", then the SpeakingEngine will say the definition of the word out loud. 
5. If the Recognizer couldn't recognize the word, or if you said "no" in step 4, Speaking Dictionary would not say the definition.
